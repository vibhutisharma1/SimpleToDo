## Notes

I encountered a challenge in building the bonus because I had constructed the graphics incorrectly so the ids were not properly able to connect with the objects.
I overcame this by deleting the button and plain text and adding them again and ensuring that I named them correctly this time. 

The videos and notes were helpful in understanding the purpose of some methods as well as justification on all the code. 
For instance, to action a tool like clicking on a button there are several prebuilt methods in Java like 'setOnClickListener' and you can
specifiy the result inside the methods of that class.
